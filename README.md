# bullet-hell-gamekit
## PROJECT ON HOLD UNTIL ECS BECOME PRODUCT READY

The project is far for completed, the idea (already partially implemented) is to hold all the bullet/movement patterns in scriptable objects, who can be easily switched, manipulated as an asset.

Touhou like bullet hell gamekit, NOT BEING DEVELOPED ANYMORE.
it's expected that the final product will offer a fully, editor based, no-code-needed, bullet hell gamekit.
